Exercise: Define the Aircraft Assignment Transaction
Section 11, Lecture 81

Aircraft resource is assigned to the flights by the Logistics department. This assignment is carried out as a separate exercise. Logistics on which aircraft is available and where it is available is managed off-chain as this information (data) is not of interest to participants other than Logistics.


Start by creating a new model project airlinev81 by copying the content from airlinev8

Steps to follow 

============

    Add the following Transaction to the model file
        org.acme.airline.flight.AssignAircraft
        Parameters: {o String flightId                      o String aircraftId}
    Add the event
        org.acme.airline.flight.AircraftAssigned
        Parameters: {o String flightId                      o String aircraftId}
    Code the Transaction Processor function AssignAircraft
        Check if flight and aircraft exist - if not throw an exception
        Use factory to create an aircraft relationship
        Assign aircraft relationship to flight
        Use registry to update the flight
    Code the unit test case 
        In before() add some test data 
        Create the test case file (Solution is in aircraft-assignment.js) .... refer to the schedule-validation.js for help :)
        Write the test cases for:
            Sunny day scenario
            FlightID does not exist

Solution:    Acme Airline v9
